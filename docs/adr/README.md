# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for
kronos-semi. An ADR captures a single significant decision: its context,
the decision itself, and its consequences. Once accepted, an ADR is
immutable. To change an accepted decision, write a new ADR that
supersedes the old one and mark the old one as Superseded.

## When to add an ADR

Add an ADR for any change that:

- Modifies an item listed under "Invariants" in `PLAN.md`.
- Introduces a new external dependency or removes one.
- Changes the target version of a core tool (dolfinx, PETSc, Python).
- Alters the input format or breaks backward compatibility of the JSON
  schema.
- Picks between multiple defensible technical approaches where the
  choice is visible to users or future maintainers.

Do **not** add ADRs for routine code changes, bug fixes, or internal
refactors that do not cross an invariant.

## Format

Each ADR is a separate markdown file named
`NNNN-short-slug.md`, numbered sequentially from 0001. Each file follows
this skeleton:

```markdown
# NNNN. Short title

- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXXX
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

What problem are we solving? What forces are at play?

## Decision

What did we decide to do? State it plainly.

## Consequences

What becomes easier, harder, or impossible as a result? Note any
follow-up ADRs that might be needed.
```

## Status values

- **Proposed:** under discussion; not binding.
- **Accepted:** in effect; code must conform.
- **Deprecated:** no longer applies but kept for historical context; no
  replacement needed.
- **Superseded by ADR-XXXX:** replaced; see the linked ADR for the
  current decision.
