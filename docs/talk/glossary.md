## 1. Physics Terms

**Acceptor (N_A)**
A p-type dopant atom (e.g., boron in silicon) that introduces a hole
into the valence band when ionized. Acceptor concentration N_A sets
the hole-dominated carrier density in p-type material.

**Band gap (E_g)**
The energy separation between the valence band maximum and the
conduction band minimum. For silicon at 300 K, E_g ≈ 1.12 eV. Charge
carriers must receive at least this energy to be excited across the
gap.

**Boltzmann statistics**
An approximation to Fermi-Dirac statistics valid when the Fermi level
is at least 3 k_B T below the conduction band and above the valence
band (non-degenerate semiconductor). Carrier densities become
n = N_C exp((E_F − E_C)/k_B T). Valid for doping below ~10¹⁹ cm⁻³.

**Built-in potential (V_bi)**
The electrostatic potential difference that develops across a pn
junction at thermal equilibrium due to the charge redistribution.
V_bi ≈ V_t ln(N_A N_D / n_i²). For symmetric 10¹⁷ cm⁻³ silicon
doping, V_bi ≈ 0.83 V.

**Carrier density (n, p)**
The number of electrons (n) or holes (p) per unit volume in the
semiconductor, measured in cm⁻³. At equilibrium, n·p = n_i².

**Continuity equation**
A PDE expressing conservation of carriers: ∇·J_n = qR (electrons),
∇·J_p = −qR (holes). States that the divergence of current equals net
generation minus recombination.

**Debye length (L_D)**
The characteristic length over which electrostatic screening occurs.
L_D = sqrt(ε V_t / q N), where N is the doping density. Sets the
width of transition regions at heterojunctions and contacts.

**Depletion approximation**
An analytical model for the space-charge region in a pn junction that
assumes the carrier density is zero in the depletion region. Gives
simple formulas for depletion width and built-in field. Accurate to a
few percent for silicon at moderate doping.

**Depletion region**
The region near a pn junction or MOS interface that is depleted of
mobile carriers due to the internal electric field. Contains ionized
dopant atoms whose charge gives rise to the space-charge field.

**Donor (N_D)**
An n-type dopant atom (e.g., phosphorus, arsenic in silicon) that
contributes a free electron to the conduction band when ionized.

**Drift current**
The component of carrier current due to carrier motion in an electric
field: J_drift = qμnE (electrons). Proportional to mobility and field.

**Drift-diffusion (DD) model**
The standard macroscopic model for semiconductor carrier transport:
current = drift + diffusion, coupled to Poisson's equation. Valid for
device feature sizes above ~50 nm where quantum and ballistic effects
are negligible.

**Diffusion current**
The component of carrier current due to concentration gradients:
J_diff = qD ∇n (electrons). Proportional to diffusivity and gradient.

**Diffusivity (D)**
Carrier diffusion coefficient. Linked to mobility by the Einstein
relation: D = μ V_t.

**Einstein relation**
D_n = μ_n k_B T / q = μ_n V_t. Links the diffusion coefficient to
mobility via the thermal voltage. Follows from requiring that drift
and diffusion balance at equilibrium.

**Electric field (E)**
E = −∇ψ. Points from high to low potential; drives carrier drift.

**Electrostatic potential (ψ)**
Scalar potential defined so that E = −∇ψ. One of the three primary
unknowns in the drift-diffusion system.

**Fermi-Dirac statistics**
The exact quantum-mechanical distribution function for electrons.
Required when the semiconductor is degenerate (heavily doped,
> ~10¹⁹ cm⁻³ in silicon). Planned in kronos-semi M16.4.

**Fermi level (E_F)**
The chemical potential of electrons. At thermal equilibrium, a single
E_F characterizes the entire device. Under bias, splits into quasi-
Fermi levels Φ_n, Φ_p for electrons and holes.

**Generation-recombination (G-R)**
Processes that create (generation) or annihilate (recombination)
electron-hole pairs. Principal mechanism in kronos-semi: SRH.

**Hole**
A missing electron in the valence band, behaving as a positive charge
carrier. Holes have their own effective mass and mobility.

**Intrinsic carrier density (n_i)**
The carrier density in undoped silicon at thermal equilibrium:
n_i ≈ 1.5 × 10¹⁰ cm⁻³ at 300 K. Sets the scale for minority carrier
injection.

**Mass-action law**
At thermal equilibrium, n·p = n_i² everywhere in the semiconductor,
independent of doping. A fundamental constraint verified in the
`pn_1d` benchmark.

**Minority carrier**
Electrons in p-type material, or holes in n-type material. Their
concentration is ~n_i²/N. Minority carrier injection under forward
bias drives diode current.

**Mobility (μ)**
The proportionality constant between carrier drift velocity and
electric field: v_d = μE. Units: cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹. In v0.16, constant
(Sze defaults). Field-dependent Caughey-Thomas mobility planned M16.1.

**n-type semiconductor**
Silicon doped with donor atoms. Majority carriers are electrons.

**Ohmic contact**
A metal-semiconductor contact that maintains charge neutrality and
thermal equilibrium at the contact surface. Implemented in kronos-semi
as Dirichlet BCs on ψ, Φ_n, and Φ_p equal to the applied voltage plus
the built-in offset.

**p-type semiconductor**
Silicon doped with acceptor atoms. Majority carriers are holes.

**Permittivity (ε)**
ε = ε_0 ε_r. Describes how strongly a material polarizes in an
electric field. ε_r(Si) ≈ 11.7; ε_r(SiO₂) ≈ 3.9.

**pn junction**
The interface between p-type and n-type semiconductor. The simplest
and most fundamental device; the basis of diodes, BJTs, and MOSFETs.

**Poisson's equation**
−∇·(ε∇ψ) = ρ = q(p − n + N_D − N_A). One of the three governing PDEs.
Relates electrostatic potential to charge density.

**Quasi-Fermi potential (Φ_n, Φ_p)**
Generalizations of the equilibrium Fermi level to non-equilibrium
conditions. Electrons follow Φ_n; holes follow Φ_p. The Slotboom
transformation uses these as primary unknowns.

**Recombination (R)**
Net rate at which electron-hole pairs annihilate. In kronos-semi:
SRH recombination through mid-gap traps. R > 0 near forward-biased
junctions; R < 0 (generation) in reverse-biased depletion regions.

**SRH recombination (Shockley-Read-Hall)**
Indirect recombination mediated by deep trap levels (impurities or
defects). Rate R = (np − n_i²) / [τ_p(n + n_1) + τ_n(p + p_1)].
Dominant recombination mechanism in indirect-gap semiconductors such
as silicon.

**Space-charge region**
See *depletion region*. Region containing net fixed ionized dopant
charge and depleted of mobile carriers.

**Thermal voltage (V_t)**
V_t = k_B T / q ≈ 25.85 mV at 300 K. The natural voltage scale for
semiconductor physics. Used as the potential normalization unit in
kronos-semi's nondimensionalization.

## 2. Numerical Methods Terms

**Adaptive continuation**
A solver strategy for nonlinear PDEs: incrementally walk from a
known solution (e.g., V = 0) to the target (e.g., V = 0.6 V) in
small steps, using each converged solution as the initial guess for
the next. Step size is halved on failure and grown on easy convergence.
Implemented in `semi/continuation.py`.

**BDF (Backward Differentiation Formula)**
A family of implicit multistep methods for time integration of ODEs
and DAEs. BDF1 = backward Euler; BDF2 uses the two most recent time
levels. Unconditionally A-stable up to order 2. Used in kronos-semi
for transient drift-diffusion (M13).

**BDF1 (Backward Euler)**
First-order BDF: (u^{n+1} − u^n) / Δt = f(u^{n+1}). Unconditionally
stable, first-order accurate in time.

**BDF2**
Second-order BDF: (3u^{n+1} − 4u^n + u^{n-1}) / (2Δt) = f(u^{n+1}).
Unconditionally stable, second-order accurate in time.

**Condition number**
For a matrix A: κ(A) = ‖A‖ · ‖A⁻¹‖. Measures sensitivity of the
linear system to perturbations. κ ~ 10³⁰ for raw DD Jacobian in SI
units; reduced to ~1–100 after nondimensionalization.

**Continuation**
See *adaptive continuation*.

**Convergence order (rate)**
The exponent p such that ‖error‖ ~ h^p as mesh spacing h → 0. Second-
order (p = 2) in L² norm is the theoretical rate for P1 Lagrange FEM
on smooth problems. Verified by the MMS suite in kronos-semi.

**Direct solver**
A linear-algebra algorithm that computes an exact factorization of the
system matrix (e.g., LU decomposition). MUMPS is the direct solver in
kronos-semi. Exact but memory-intensive for large 3D problems.

**DOF (degree of freedom)**
A scalar unknown in the discretized PDE system. For P1 elements, one
DOF per mesh vertex per field. Total DOFs ≈ N_vertices × N_fields.

**FEM (Finite Element Method)**
A numerical PDE discretization based on a weak (variational) form.
The domain is divided into elements; the solution is approximated by
piecewise polynomial basis functions. kronos-semi uses FEniCSx/dolfinx
as its FEM backend.

**Galerkin FEM**
The standard FEM formulation where test functions are from the same
space as trial functions. Galerkin FEM on the Slotboom form of the
drift-diffusion equations is stable and gives second-order convergence
without stabilization.

**H¹ norm (H^1, H-one)**
Sobolev norm including both the L² norm of the function and its
gradient: ‖u‖²_{H¹} = ‖u‖²_{L²} + ‖∇u‖²_{L²}. Theoretical FEM
convergence for the gradient (potential, field) is first-order in H¹.

**Iterative solver**
A linear algebra algorithm that produces successive approximations to
the exact solution (e.g., GMRES, CG). Requires a preconditioner for
efficiency on ill-conditioned systems.

**Jacobian**
The matrix of partial derivatives ∂F_i/∂u_j of the nonlinear residual
F with respect to the unknowns u. Newton's method requires a Jacobian
solve at each iteration.

**L² norm (L-two)**
The root-mean-square error over the domain: ‖e‖_{L²} = sqrt(∫e²dΩ).
Theoretical FEM convergence for the solution itself is second-order in
L² for smooth problems on quasi-uniform meshes.

**MMS (Method of Manufactured Solutions)**
A V&V technique: choose an arbitrary "manufactured" exact solution
u_exact, compute the body force f that makes it satisfy the PDE
exactly, solve the modified problem numerically, and measure the error
‖u_h − u_exact‖ as the mesh is refined. The convergence rate (p ≈ 2
for P1 FEM) confirms correct implementation. MMS catches sign errors,
coefficient errors, and coupling bugs that single-point benchmarks miss.

**Multigrid**
An iterative solver that uses a hierarchy of coarser meshes to
efficiently damp errors at all spatial scales. Algebraic multigrid
(AMG) builds the hierarchy algebraically from the matrix. Used in
hypre BoomerAMG (GPU path).

**MUMPS**
MUltifrontal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver. The default
linear solver backend in kronos-semi for CPU solves. Exact LU
factorization; robust on ill-conditioned systems.

**Newton's method (Newton-Raphson)**
An iterative algorithm for solving nonlinear systems F(u) = 0 by
repeated linearization: u^{k+1} = u^k − J^{−1} F(u^k). Quadratic
convergence near the root; requires a good initial guess.

**Nondimensionalization**
The process of scaling physical variables so that they are O(1) in
the computation. In kronos-semi: potentials scaled by V_t, densities
by C_0 (peak doping), spatial coordinates kept in meters. Reduces
Jacobian condition number from ~10³⁰ to manageable levels.

**Péclet number (local)**
For convection-diffusion problems: Pe = |velocity| · h / diffusivity.
Pe >> 1 means convection dominates and standard Galerkin FEM produces
spurious oscillations. The Slotboom transformation eliminates
high-Péclet stiffness in the DD continuity equations.

**PETSc**
Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation. A library of
data structures and solvers for large-scale linear and nonlinear
algebra. kronos-semi uses PETSc via petsc4py for Newton (SNES),
linear solvers (KSP), and GPU backends.

**P1 Lagrange elements**
Piecewise linear (first-degree polynomial) finite elements. One DOF
per vertex; continuous across element boundaries. Standard choice for
Poisson and drift-diffusion in FEniCSx.

**Preconditioner**
A matrix M ≈ A^{−1} used to improve the convergence of iterative
linear solvers. AMGX and hypre BoomerAMG are AMG preconditioners used
in the kronos-semi GPU path.

**Residual**
The vector F(u) measuring how far the current solution u is from
satisfying the PDE discretization F(u) = 0. Newton converges when
‖F‖ < tolerance.

**Scharfetter-Gummel (SG) discretization**
A finite-volume edge-based discretization for the drift-diffusion
current that is exact for exponential profiles in 1D. Guarantees
positive carrier densities. Used in COMSOL and many TCAD codes.
kronos-semi uses the Slotboom transformation instead, which achieves
equivalent stability on FEM meshes with higher-order convergence.

**Singular perturbation**
A PDE whose small parameter multiplies the highest derivative, causing
the solution to have thin boundary layers. The Debye-length parameter
λ² in the scaled Poisson equation is a singular perturbation;
physically this is why space-charge layers are narrow.

**Slotboom transformation**
Change of primary unknowns from (ψ, n, p) to (ψ, Φ_n, Φ_p). Rewrites
drift-diffusion currents as pure gradients, making the weak form
coercive and Galerkin-stable without upwinding. Locked in ADR 0004.

**SNES (Scalable Nonlinear Equations Solver)**
The PETSc component for Newton-type nonlinear solvers. kronos-semi
uses SNES for the outer Newton loop and KSP for the inner linear
solves.

**SUPG (Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin)**
A stabilization technique for convection-dominated PDEs that adds
artificial diffusion along streamlines. Not used in kronos-semi —
the Slotboom transformation eliminates the need for stabilization.

**UFL (Unified Form Language)**
A domain-specific language for expressing weak forms of PDEs in
FEniCSx. UFL expressions are compiled to efficient C++ kernels by
FFCx (FEniCSx Form Compiler). Weak forms in `semi/physics/` are
written in UFL.

**Weak form**
The variational (integral) form of a PDE obtained by multiplying by
a test function and integrating by parts. The FEM is based on the
weak form; Neumann boundary conditions appear naturally as boundary
integrals.
