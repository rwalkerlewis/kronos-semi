A JSON-driven finite-element semiconductor device simulator built on FEniCSx
(dolfinx 0.10). Solves Poisson-coupled drift-diffusion with SRH recombination
on 1D, 2D, and 3D meshes, with an HTTP API for programmatic access.
The engine is JSON-in / artifact-out: a single JSON file describes the
device, the run produces a schema-validated result tree on disk, and an
HTTP server lets a UI or another tool drive solves remotely.

section.

## Status

The current package version is v0.16.0. The engine ships equilibrium
Poisson, coupled Slotboom drift-diffusion with SRH recombination, a
2D MOSFET, transient and AC small-signal solvers, an axisymmetric
2D MOSCAP path, an optional GPU linear-solver backend, and a strict
JSON input schema (v2.0.0).

What the engine does today, in plain terms:

- **Equilibrium Poisson** in 1D, 2D, 3D, multi-region (Si/SiO2 with
  cellwise eps_r and the natural flux-continuity interface condition).
- **Coupled Slotboom drift-diffusion bias sweeps** with adaptive
  step-size continuation in `AdaptiveStepController`; SRH recombination
  with configurable trap energy; supports unipolar and zero-spanning
  bipolar sweeps.
- **2D MOSFET** with Gaussian n+ source/drain implants on the
  multi-region Poisson + Slotboom DD stack. The `mosfet_2d` verifier
  applies the Pao-Sah linear-regime analytical reference in
  `[V_T + 0.2, V_T + 0.6]` V at `V_DS = 0.05` V with a 20% tolerance.
- **Transient solver** with BDF1 (backward Euler) and BDF2 time
  integration in Slotboom (psi, phi_n, phi_p) primary unknowns
  (ADRs 0010, 0014). Both `test_transient_steady_state_limit` and the
  BDF rate tests are active; the deep-steady-state runner matches
  `bias_sweep` within 1e-4 relative error and the `pn_1d_turnon`
  benchmark is within 5%.
- **MOS capacitor C-V via analytic AC**: the `mos_cap_ac` runner
  solves the linearised Poisson sensitivity at each gate bias to
  return dQ/dV directly in F/m^2, replacing the noisier
  `numpy.gradient(Q, V)` of `mos_cv`. Worst error 6.79% vs the
  depletion-approximation reference in the verifier window; audit case
  03 confirms `mos_cv` and `mos_cap_ac` agree on Q_gate to machine
  precision.
- **Small-signal AC sweep** for two-terminal pn diodes:
  `(J + jωM) δu = -dF/dV δV` solved via real 2x2 block reformulation;
  the `rc_ac_sweep` benchmark matches analytical depletion C within
  0.4% over [1 Hz, 1 MHz] (ADR 0011).
- **3D doped resistor** with V-I linearity within 1%, builtin or
  gmsh-sourced unstructured meshes.
- **Axisymmetric (cylindrical) 2D MOSCAP** with r-weighted Poisson and
  Slotboom drift-diffusion on the meridian half-plane. The schema
  exposes a top-level `coordinate_system` field (`"cartesian"`
  default, `"axisymmetric"` optional). Cross-field validation enforces
  dimension == 2 and rejects Dirichlet contacts on the symmetry axis
  r = 0. Pure-Python MOSCAP analytical helpers (`semi/cv.py`) provide
  V_fb, V_t, |phi_B|, W_dmax, C_ox, C_min and LF/HF C-V curves; the
  gmsh `.geo` template under `benchmarks/moscap_axisym_2d/` reproduces
  Hu Fig. 5-18 parameters. See
  [docs/theory/axisymmetric.md](docs/theory/axisymmetric.md) and
  [docs/theory/moscap_cv.md](docs/theory/moscap_cv.md).
- **Optional GPU linear-solver path**: set `solver.backend` to
  `gpu-amgx`, `gpu-hypre`, or `auto` (default `cpu-mumps`, bit-
  identical to the pre-GPU CPU path). Each Newton step's linear solve
  runs on the device with AMGX or hypre BoomerAMG, gated on
  PETSc-CUDA / PETSc-HIP availability. The `GET /capabilities`
  endpoint reports the host's available backends for UI gating. See
  [docs/gpu.md](docs/gpu.md).
- **Mesh ingest** for builtin axis-aligned 1D/2D/3D boxes, gmsh `.msh`
  via `dolfinx.io.gmsh.read_from_msh`, and XDMF via
  `dolfinx.io.XDMFFile.read_mesh` / `read_meshtags`. Physical groups
  propagate verbatim as cell and facet tags.
- **On-disk result artifacts**: schema-validated `manifest.json`,
  fields, IV CSVs, and convergence logs under `runs/<run_id>/`.
- **HTTP API**: `POST /solve`, progress over WebSocket,
  `GET /runs/{id}/manifest`, `GET /capabilities`, `GET /materials`,
  `GET /schema`. The server process imports no dolfinx at module
  scope; FEM work happens in spawned worker subprocesses.
- **Schema versioning with strict mode and UI annotations**: the
  active schema is `schemas/input.v2.json` (Draft-07,
  `additionalProperties: false` so input typos fail validation). The
  legacy `schemas/input.v1.json` is accepted for one minor cycle and
  emits a `DeprecationWarning`. Every object node carries a
  description for UI form generators.
- **V&V**: MMS for Poisson (1D linear/nonlinear, 2D triangles, 2D
  multi-region), mesh convergence, charge / current conservation, MMS
  for coupled DD across three variants and three grids; finest-pair
  rates at theoretical L2 = 2.000.
- **CI**: lint + pure-Python on Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 + dolfinx
  benchmarks + V&V on every push, coverage gate at 95%.

Per-milestone delivery history is in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md);
per-version detail is in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## Where this is going

The forward-looking milestone backlog (Tier-1 physics in M16, the 3D
MOSFET capstone in M19, MPI in M19.1, HTTP hardening in M20) lives in
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) and
[`docs/IMPROVEMENT_GUIDE.md`](docs/IMPROVEMENT_GUIDE.md).
[`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) names the single in-flight task.

## Orientation

Four entry points, depending on what you want to do.

### I want to understand the physics without a TCAD background

Read [docs/PHYSICS_INTRO.md](docs/PHYSICS_INTRO.md). Tutorial-style, assumes
programming literacy and calculus but not device physics. About 30 minutes.

### I want to understand the code architecture

Read [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the five-layer design
and import rules, then [docs/WALKTHROUGH.md](docs/WALKTHROUGH.md) for an
end-to-end trace of what happens when you call `semi.run.run(cfg)`, with
file and line anchors.

### I want to extend the physics or solver

Read [docs/PHYSICS.md](docs/PHYSICS.md) for the full equation and scaling
reference, then the existing derivation documents under `docs/` (one per
non-trivial device class), then [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) for locked
decisions. Every new physics model needs an MMS verifier — read ADR 0006.

### I want to pick up work from the roadmap

Read [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for current state and next task, then the specific
milestone section of [docs/IMPROVEMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/IMPROVEMENT_GUIDE.md).
Each milestone has an acceptance test that gates merge — do not negotiate
around it.

Click the badge above, or use the direct link:

```
https://colab.research.google.com/github/rwalkerlewis/kronos-semi/blob/main/notebooks/01_pn_junction_1d.ipynb
```

The first cell installs FEniCSx on Colab via [FEM on Colab](https://fem-on-colab.github.io/)
(~30 s). Subsequent cells clone this repo, load a JSON benchmark, run the
solve, and plot against analytical curves.

## Local install

dolfinx installs most reliably via conda:

```bash
conda create -n kronos-semi -c conda-forge python=3.12 fenics-dolfinx mpich pyvista
conda activate kronos-semi
git clone https://github.com/rwalkerlewis/kronos-semi.git
cd kronos-semi
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

For HTTP server support, include the `server` extra:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,server]"
```

The pure-Python layer (`schema`, `materials`, `scaling`, `doping`,
`constants`) does not need dolfinx and installs standalone via
`pip install -e .` — useful for schema validation and unit tests in
CI environments without a FEM toolchain. The `server` process also
imports no dolfinx at module scope; FEM work happens in spawned worker
subprocesses.

## Running the HTTP server (M10)

The `kronos-server` console entry point starts a FastAPI server that
exposes the engine over HTTP:

```bash
kronos-server                           # 127.0.0.1:8000 by default
KRONOS_SERVER_PORT=8080 kronos-server   # or via env vars
```

Under Docker Compose, the `server` service runs the same entry point:

```bash
docker compose up -d server
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/capabilities | python -m json.tool
```

### Example: submit a solve over HTTP

```bash
# Submit a benchmark as a JSON body
RUN_ID=$(curl -sf -X POST http://localhost:8000/solve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @benchmarks/pn_1d/pn_junction.json \
  | python -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["run_id"])')

# Poll until complete
while true; do
  STATUS=$(curl -sf http://localhost:8000/runs/$RUN_ID \
    | python -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["status"])')
  [ "$STATUS" = "completed" ] && break
  sleep 2
done

# Fetch the manifest and an IV CSV
curl -sf http://localhost:8000/runs/$RUN_ID/manifest
curl -sf http://localhost:8000/runs/$RUN_ID/iv/cathode
```

OpenAPI spec at `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json`, Swagger UI at
`/docs`. Full endpoint reference in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) under the `[0.10.0]` entry.

## Docker

Reproducible dev environment on top of `ghcr.io/fenics/dolfinx/dolfinx:stable`:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm test                       # full pytest including FEM tests
docker compose run --rm benchmark pn_1d            # run a benchmark
docker compose up -d dev && docker compose exec dev bash
docker compose up jupyter                          # JupyterLab on :8888
docker compose up -d server                        # HTTP server on :8000
```

## Running benchmarks

```bash
docker compose run --rm benchmark pn_1d
docker compose run --rm benchmark pn_1d_bias
docker compose run --rm benchmark pn_1d_bias_reverse
docker compose run --rm benchmark mos_2d
docker compose run --rm benchmark resistor_3d
```

Each benchmark is a JSON file under `benchmarks/<n>/`. The CLI loads it,
runs the solver, checks a registered verifier, and writes plots to
`results/<n>/`.

From Python:

```python
from semi import schema, run

cfg = schema.load("benchmarks/pn_1d/pn_junction.json")
result = run.run(cfg)

# result.psi_phys, result.n_phys, result.p_phys are numpy arrays
# result.x_dof gives the mesh coordinates
# result.iv is a list of {"V": ..., "J": ...} dicts (for bias sweeps)
```

`result` is a `SimulationResult` dataclass; see
[docs/WALKTHROUGH.md §11](docs/WALKTHROUGH.md) for the full schema and
caveats about dolfinx-backed fields not being serializable.

To persist a result to disk for later reading (including from an
environment without dolfinx), use the M9 artifact writer:

```bash
semi-run benchmarks/pn_1d/pn_junction.json --out runs/
```

The resulting `runs/<run_id>/` directory contains a schema-validated
`manifest.json`, the input JSON, mesh and field files, IV CSVs, and
convergence logs.

## JSON input example

Minimal 1D pn junction:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "2.0.0",
  "name": "pn_junction_1d",
  "dimension": 1,
  "mesh": {
    "source": "builtin",
    "extents": [[0.0, 2.0e-6]],
    "resolution": [400],
    "facets_by_plane": [
      {"name": "anode",   "tag": 1, "axis": 0, "value": 0.0},
      {"name": "cathode", "tag": 2, "axis": 0, "value": 2.0e-6}
    ]
  },
  "regions": {
    "silicon": {"material": "Si", "tag": 1, "role": "semiconductor"}
  },
  "doping": [
    {
      "region": "silicon",
      "profile": {
        "type": "step", "axis": 0, "location": 1.0e-6,
        "N_D_left": 0.0,  "N_A_left": 1.0e17,
        "N_D_right": 1.0e17, "N_A_right": 0.0
      }
    }
  ],
  "contacts": [
    {"name": "anode",   "facet": "anode",   "type": "ohmic", "voltage": 0.0},
    {"name": "cathode", "facet": "cathode", "type": "ohmic", "voltage": 0.0}
  ]
}
```

Doping densities in JSON are in cm⁻³ (device-physics tradition); everything
else is SI. The strict default schema is `schemas/input.v2.json` (JSON
Schema Draft-07 with `additionalProperties: false`, every object node
annotated with a UI-facing description); the legacy
`schemas/input.v1.json` is accepted but emits a `DeprecationWarning`
and will be removed after one minor release cycle. See
[docs/schema/reference.md](docs/schema/reference.md) for the
field-by-field reference and the axisymmetric extension. Every input
JSON must declare a top-level `"schema_version"`; the engine accepts
majors listed in `ENGINE_SUPPORTED_SCHEMA_MAJORS` in `semi/schema.py`
(currently `(1, 2)`).

## Scope vs COMSOL Semiconductor Module

kronos-semi covers the **quasi-static, steady-state** subset.

**In scope (shipped):**

- Poisson with multi-region dielectric (Si/SiO2)
- Drift-diffusion in Slotboom (quasi-Fermi potential) form
- SRH recombination with configurable mid-gap trap energy
- Ohmic contacts and ideal gate contacts with work-function offset
- 1D, 2D, and 3D structured meshes (builtin); 3D unstructured meshes
  via gmsh `.msh` and XDMF ingest
- Bias sweeps with adaptive step-size continuation (unipolar and bipolar)
- Method-of-Manufactured-Solutions and conservation V&V suite
- Machine-readable on-disk result artifacts (schema-validated manifests)
- HTTP API with solve submission, progress streaming, and artifact fetch
- 2D MOSFET with Gaussian n+ source/drain implants and a Pao-Sah
  linear-regime analytical verifier
- Transient BDF1 / BDF2 in Slotboom primary unknowns
- Small-signal AC sweep on two-terminal pn devices, plus the
  `mos_cap_ac` runner for analytic differential C(V_gate)
- Axisymmetric (cylindrical) 2D MOSCAP with r-weighted Poisson and
  Slotboom drift-diffusion
- Optional GPU linear-solver path (PETSc CUDA / HIP via AMGX or
  hypre BoomerAMG)
- Strict-mode schema (`additionalProperties: false`) so input typos
  fail validation rather than being silently dropped

**Out of scope today (see [docs/IMPROVEMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/IMPROVEMENT_GUIDE.md)
and [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)):**

- Caughey-Thomas / Lombardi field-dependent mobility (M16.1, M16.2)
- Auger and radiative recombination (M16.3)
- Fermi-Dirac statistics (M16.4; Boltzmann throughout today, valid
  below ~10¹⁹ cm⁻³)
- Schottky contacts and contact resistance models (M16.5)
- Band-to-band or trap-assisted tunneling (M16.6)
- Time-varying transient contact voltage (M16.7)
- Heterojunctions and position-dependent band structure (M17)
- 3D MOSFET / FinFET capstone benchmark (M19); MPI parallel
  orchestration (M19.1); HTTP server hardening (M20)
- GUI or web frontend (M18, separate repo)
- Impact ionization and avalanche generation (unscheduled)
- Thermal coupling / self-heating (unscheduled)
- Optical generation (unscheduled)

## Design notes

The engine pairs three deliberate choices: nondimensional scaling
(Newton on raw 10³⁰-conditioned Jacobians diverges immediately),
Slotboom quasi-Fermi variables (Galerkin on raw drift-diffusion is
unstable when drift dominates diffusion), and dolfinx 0.10's
`NonlinearProblem` wrapping PETSc SNES (line search, block systems,
convergence diagnostics). The full reasoning, with code anchors and
ADR cross-references, lives under [docs/theory/](docs/theory/):
[scaling](docs/theory/scaling.md),
[slotboom](docs/theory/slotboom.md),
[dolfinx_choice](docs/theory/dolfinx_choice.md),
[axisymmetric](docs/theory/axisymmetric.md),
[moscap_cv](docs/theory/moscap_cv.md).

### Why no dolfinx in the server process

`kronos_server/` never imports dolfinx, UFL, or PETSc at module scope.
FEM work happens only in worker subprocesses spawned via
`ProcessPoolExecutor(mp_context="spawn")`. A server process can start
and serve `/health`, `/ready`, `/capabilities`, and `/schema` in a
pure-Python environment without the FEM stack, which is useful for
smoke-tested deployments and for UI developers who want a static mock
server.

## Verification

Analytical sanity checks are runnable without dolfinx. The
analytical-math helper `tests/check_analytical_math.py` covers thermal voltage,
Debye length, built-in potential, mass-action, charge neutrality,
and peak |E|.

```bash
python tests/check_analytical_math.py    # runs offline, no dolfinx required
pytest tests/                      # full suite under Docker, FEM included
python scripts/run_verification.py # V&V suite (MMS, conservation)
```
